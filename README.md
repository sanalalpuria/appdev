## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Browse Menu:**
   Users view all menu items dynamically rendered from a JS object or JSON data.

2. **Add Items to Cart:**
   Each menu item includes an “Add to Cart” button that updates the cart count and total dynamically.

3. **View Cart:**
   The cart page displays selected items, quantities, and the running total.

4. **Place Order:**
   Users can confirm their order — triggering a success message or order summary.
